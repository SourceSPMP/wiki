# Portal 2 (PS3)

Portal 2 for the PS3 was made by Valve back in April 18th 2011.
The way the engine was ported is so different from [[PS3/The Orange Box]] version that you might as well call them different engines.

# The yellow triangle

When you rename `portal2/zip0.ps3.zip` the game will fail to load game assets and display a petscop-like shaking triangle with beveled edges and a low poly red exclamation mark.

# Plugins support

Portal 2 has working addons folder support. That means, in theory, you can port [SourceMod][https://sourcemod.net/] to the PS3.

This was used to fix the multiplayer cross-play functionality, as it was disabled by Valve from using the normal socket based method.

Here is a [guide][PS3/Portal 2/Multiplayer/Tutorial] on how to set up multiplayer for the version.
