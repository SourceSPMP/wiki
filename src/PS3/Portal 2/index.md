# Portal 2 (PS3)

Portal 2 for the PS3 was made by Valve back in April 18th 2011.
The way the engine was ported is so different from [[PS3/The Orange Box]] version that you might as well call them different engines.

# The yellow triangle

When you rename `portal2/zip0.ps3.zip` the game will fail to load game assets and display a petscop-like shaking triangle with beveled edges and a low poly red exclamation mark.
