# Custom Folder

1. Download the custom folder from [Here][https://github.com/SourceSPMP/custom/archive/refs/heads/main.zip]

2. Go to desired game folder (i.e. `steamapps/common/Half-Life 2/hl2`) and make a folder named "custom" if there isn't one already

3. Extract the zip to the "custom" folder, structure should look similar to below:
```
steamapps/common/Half-Life 2/hl2/custom
├───dingus
│   ├───materials
│   │   └───models
│   │       └───dingus
│   └───models
│       └───dingus
├───menuoptions
│   └───resource
└───playermodelFIX
    ├───materials
    │   └───models
    │       └───player
    └───models
```

4. Verify it works

{{TODO|probably elaborate on what the custom folder & SPMP repo is for?}}
