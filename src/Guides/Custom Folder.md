# Custom Folder

1. Download the custom folder from [Here][https://github.com/SourceSPMP/custom/archive/refs/heads/main.zip]

2. Go to desired game folder (i.e. `steamapps/common/Half-Life 2/hl2`) and make a folder named "custom" if there isn't one already

3. Drag folders from the `custom` folder inside the zip to the `custom` folder inside your game, structure should look similar to below:
```
steamapps/common/Half-Life 2/hl2/custom
├───Folder1
├───Folder2
│ ...
```

It is recommended to get the `menuoptions` folder from the zip file.

5. Verify it works

{{TODO|probably elaborate on what the custom folder & SPMP repo is for?}}
